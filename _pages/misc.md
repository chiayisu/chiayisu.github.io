Outside of work, I like to play the guitar, fly the airplain, go skiing, ice skating, and hiking. In addition, I also enjoy playing guitar in the worship team. Here are some videos of me playing guitar in the worship team and flying airplain:

## Worship 
Occationally, I played guitar at the worship team at [Redemmer church](https://redeemer.ch/) at Niles, Michigan. Here are few videos:

## Pilot Training
When I have times, I like to fly the airplain. Here is the photo that I took in Fall last year when I went out to practice some maneuvering. I'm still a student pilot because I've been busy and don't have too much time to fly recently.
