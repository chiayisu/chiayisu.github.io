I'm a final-year master student at [National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology](https://eng.nkust.edu.tw/index.php), Taiwan, R.O.C. I major in [Electronic Engineering](http://www.ec.kuas.edu.tw/en/). I am now advised by Professor [Tsong-Yi Chen](http://www.msp.nkust.edu.tw/en/%e9%99%b3%e8%81%b0%e6%af%85%e5%8a%a9%e7%90%86%e6%95%99%e6%8e%88/). My current research focuses on how to endow robots with the ability to retrieve medical information through natural language interaction. Specifically, my research areas are Interactive Dialog System, Natural Language Understanding, Human-Computer Interaction, and Reinforcement Learning.
