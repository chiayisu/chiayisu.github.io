I'm a Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D. Candidate at [University of Notre Dame](https://cse.nd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Collin McMillan](https://sdf.org/~cmc/) in [Automatic Program Comprehension Lab](https://github.com/apcl-research). I work on large language models (LLMs) for program comprehension tasks. Specifically, I focus on aligning model behavior with how human programmers comprehend and describe code. My work aims to bridge the gap between automated code intelligence and human-level code comprehension.

I am actively looking for full-time ML/LLM research scientist opportunities in the industry starting 2025/2026. If you know of any opportunity, please feel free to reach out!
