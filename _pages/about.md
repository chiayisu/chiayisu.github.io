I'm a Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D. Candidate at [University of Notre Dame](https://cse.nd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Collin McMillan](https://sdf.org/~cmc/) in [Automatic Program Comprehension Lab](https://github.com/apcl-research). My research combines empirical research and technical research to develop language models for source code summarization. Specifically, I work on LLMs that generate source code summary that describe the purpose of source code based on what human programmers do for this task.

I am actively looking for full-time ML/LLM research scientist opportunities in the industry starting September/December 2025. If you know of any opportunity, please feel free to reach out!
