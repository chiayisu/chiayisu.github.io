I'm a final-year master student at [National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology](https://eng.nkust.edu.tw/index.php), Taiwan, R.O.C. I major in [Electronic Engineering](http://www.ec.kuas.edu.tw/en/). I am now advised by Professor [Tsong-Yi Chen](http://www.msp.nkust.edu.tw/en/%e9%99%b3%e8%81%b0%e6%af%85%e5%8a%a9%e7%90%86%e6%95%99%e6%8e%88/). My current research focuses on interactive systems for information retrieval. Starting this Fall, I will join Professor [Yanfang (Fanny) Ye](http://yes-lab.org/)'s team in [CSE](https://cse.nd.edu/) at [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) to conduct research on graph theory. I look forward to joining the community to work with great collegues at Professor Ye's team.
