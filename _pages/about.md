I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, working under the guidance of Prof. Collin McMillan in the Automatic Program Comprehension Lab. My research focuses on developing and evaluating large language models (LLMs) for source code summarization, with a particular emphasis on aligning model behavior with how human programmers comprehend and describe code. I combine empirical software engineering techniques with deep learning methods—including reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), prompt engineering, and model fine-tuning—to improve LLM reasoning and semantic understanding of code. My work aims to bridge the gap between automated code intelligence and human-level comprehension.

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D. Candidate at [University of Notre Dame](https://cse.nd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Collin McMillan](https://sdf.org/~cmc/) in [Automatic Program Comprehension Lab](https://github.com/apcl-research). My research focuses on developing and evaluating large language models (LLMs) for source code summarization, with a particular emphasis on aligning model behavior with how human programmers comprehend and describe code. I combine empirical software engineering techniques with deep learning methods—including reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), prompt engineering, and model fine-tuning—to generate the source code summary. My work aims to bridge the gap between automated code intelligence and human-level comprehension.

I am actively looking for full-time ML/LLM research scientist opportunities in the industry starting September/December 2025. If you know of any opportunity, please feel free to reach out!
