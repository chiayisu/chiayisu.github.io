I'm a final-year master student at National Kaohsiung University of Technology and Science, Taiwan, ROC. I major in Electronic Engineering. I am now advised by Professor Tsong-Yi Chen. My current researches focus on how to endow robots with the ability to retrieve information through natural language interaction. Specifically, I focus the researches on Interactive Dialog System, Natural Language Understanding, Human-Computer Interaction, and Reinforcement Learning.
