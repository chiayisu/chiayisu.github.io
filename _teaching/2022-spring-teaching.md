## Course Description
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied to many applications such as dialog system, robotics, and AlphaGo. RL mimics the learning behaviors of human beings and endows the system with the ability to learn through the trial-and-error method. The course will introduce the foundamental theories and the advanced theories of RL. We will start from Markolv decision process to deep RL. Moreover, we will introduce the applications of RL. More specifically, we focus our applications on dialog systems. After this course, students will have foundamental concepts to do RL research.
